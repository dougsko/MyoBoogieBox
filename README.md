MyoBoogieBox
=========

Originally forked from https://github.com/vytis/BoogieBox, this application is a percussion sequencer that can be controlled with a Myo armband.

It gets its data from the [Myo Websockets Server](https://github.com/dougsko/MyoWsServer) and should be compatible with the [myodaemon](https://github.com/thalmic-alpha/myodaemon) OSX app.

# Usage

```bash
ant
java Scene [websocket server hostname]
```
