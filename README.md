BoogieBox
=========

A simple music app inspired by Yamaha
[Tenori-On](http://tenori-on.yamaha-europe.com/).
Every row has a different MIDI instrument assigned to it, so click anywhere and
see/hear what happens.

to launch it type:
    javac *.java && java scene

Known issues: after a while, the line starts to lag behind sound. No idea why is that
happening...
